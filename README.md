# balloon-modelling

This is the description of the balloon executable file.



System Requirements:

- PC with some memory and processor. According to the Tim Taylor "More Power"-Rule more and faster and bigger produce better results. I think about 300MHz should do it. Having a 3D graphics accelerator with OpenGL support helps a lot.

- Operating System from Microsoft (Win 95/98.Me, WinNT4.0, Win2000 or later) with the OpenGL library installed (always installed, except for Win95).

- a Keyboard (or any device to take its function) for creating the files and a (possibly color) display would be nice.



Usage of the program:

- The executable takes one parameter (on the command line) - the input file.
e.g.: balloon filename.bal

- filename.bal CAN NOT include any whitespaces!
- description of the .bal files can be found in description.jpg

Some sample balloon files can be found in the "samples" subdirectory.
